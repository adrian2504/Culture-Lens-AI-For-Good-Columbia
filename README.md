## The Problem

I love visiting museums, historical places, and religious sites. But when I walk through places like Washington Square Park and see names like Giuseppe Garibaldi or Sybil Ludington, I often wonder who they are. While these figures may be well known within the local culture and history, someone like me, who isn't from here, may not understand their significance or the role they played, and as a result, the importance of the sculpture can be lost.

On the other hand, if I learn more about who this person was, what they stood for, or how their story connects to my own culture or experiences, I can engage with the artwork on a much deeper level. That context transforms the sculpture from something I simply pass by into something I can truly understand and appreciate.

**Today's digital guides and AI systems present culture through a single dominant narrative**, often shaped by historical power imbalances, colonial perspectives, or limited datasets. This risks reducing rich, living cultures into simplified explanations and unintentionally marginalizing voices that do not fit a "standard" interpretation.

##  My Solution

**CultureLens** is an AI-agent based computer vision application designed to transform how people experience art, monuments, and cultural heritage by **embracing diversity as a source of knowledge** rather than a problem of cultural barriers.

By combining edge-based computer vision, agent-driven AI reasoning, and community-informed perspectives, CultureLens allows users to point their camera at a painting or monument and receive explanations through **multiple cultural lenses**. These lenses reflect how people from different backgrounds—such as local communities, religious traditions, or regional cultures—interpret meaning, emotion, and historical significance differently.

**Rather than asking "What is the correct explanation?", CultureLens asks: "How do different people understand the same heritage, and why?"**

This shift is the core of our **AI for Good** mission.
